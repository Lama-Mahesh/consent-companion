Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.\n\n### Safety and integrity\n\nWe can take action according to our Community Standards against someone without an account interacting with Meta Products. For example, we can share information with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.\n\n### Advertising\n\nFor example, you may also see ads for the [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-company-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) shown through [Meta Audience Network](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) when you visit other apps if we can't recognise you as a registered user of the Meta Products.\n\n### Performance\n\nFor example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don't have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.\n\n5\n\nInformation that you provide\n----------------------------\n\nFor example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, such as a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, such as a profile photo or payment information.\n\nWe also collect information you provide when you:\n\n* Create your avatar\n* Fill in a form\n* Contact us\n\n6\n\nWhat we collect from our camera feature\n---------------------------------------\n\nJosé likes using Instagram's Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo that he's about to take, we collect information from the camera, so we can apply the effect to his photo.\n\nHow filters, effects, masks and avatars work\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things such as fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It's not used to identify you.\n\nWhat we collect from voice-enabled features\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRen tells Meta's voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren's command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren's voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren's settings, improve the Assistant feature.\n\n7\n\nMetadata\n--------\n\n* Information about the content itself, such as the location where a photo was taken or the date that a file was created\n* Information about the message itself, such as the type of message or the date and time that it was sent\n\n8\n\nInformation that you or others exchange with AI at Meta\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcross Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta's generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/genai?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).\n\nWe collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:\n\n* Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information that you or others share with or send to AI at Meta\n* Responses and other information that you receive from AI at Meta. Sometimes, these are provided with the help of our [AI integrations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange#4.subpage.15-AiIntegrations)\n* Actions that you ask AI at Meta to take, such as customising the content or ads that you see\n* Feedback that you give to AI at Meta about its responses\n\n9\n\nApps and features that you use, and how you use them\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, we log:\n\n* What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products\n* What features you access from our messaging products\n* When you use [Social plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/facebook-login/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou), in-app browser link history or auto-fill\n* Information about websites that you visit or interact with when you use our in-app browser.

For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.\n\n28\n\nManual review\n-------------\n\n### Examples of when we use manual review\n\n* Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies, and keep content that doesn't break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf).\n* When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.\n* We also use manual review to analyse content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.\n\n### Who reviews this information\n\nOur reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) or for a trusted [service provider\\[41\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf#annotation-41). We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.\n\n[Learn more](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fimproving%2Fprioritizing-content-review%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) about how Meta prioritises content for manual review.\n\n29\n\nWhat Products does this Policy cover?\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis Policy describes the information that we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A0.ex.0-WhatProductsDoesThis), which we also call \"Products\".\n\n30\n\nYour activity on our Products\n-----------------------------\n\nFor example, William checks in to a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.\n\nYour activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe shop or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The seller shares Jane's activity with us using our business tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.\n\nLater, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online shop.\n\nIf she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe shop again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur). Or if she doesn't want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nTopics that we think you might be interested in\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in \"music\".\n\nBased on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.\n\nJon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nYour connections\n----------------\n\nFor example, Fiona's friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend's activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.\n\n31\n\nOther device signals we receive\n-------------------------------\n\nWe receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things such as nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.\n\n32\n\nIP address\n----------\n\nStands for \"Internet protocol address\". It's a unique number assigned to a device, such as a phone or computer, which allows it to communicate over the Internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.\n\nJust like you need a postal address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the Internet.\n\n33\n\nPersonalising ads for you and others\n------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location services on his device and allowed location access in the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We'll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.\n\nLater, Marcus turns off Location services before he lands, so we don't collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address that we receive to estimate Marcus' general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.\n\n34\n\nHelping to keep your account secure\n-----------------------------------\n\nFor example, we use information about the locations that you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log in to your account from a new location, we can check that it's really you.\n\n35\n\nPartner\n-------\n\nA person, business, organisation or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services\n\n36\n\nInformation we provide about different types of people\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25-34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.\n\n37\n\nThird party\n-----------\n\nA person, business, organisation or body that is not part of the Meta Companies\n\n38\n\nProviding more personalised features, content and suggestions across our Products\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example we can:\n\n* Automatically fill in registration information, such as your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product\n* Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you\n* Show all interactions in one place for content you've crossposted to different Products\n\n39\n\nUsing your information if you add accounts to the same Accounts Centre\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, if you follow your favourite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team's Page on Facebook.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/433719745369721/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.7-UsingYourInformationIf) about how we use information across accounts if you add accounts to the same Accounts Centre.\n\n40\n\nDevice\n------\n\nDevices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.\n\n41\n\nService provider\n----------------\n\nA person, business, organisation or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta.

When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information.

The website developer automatically receives information about your \"like\" on their article.\n\n49\n\nSharing friend lists\n--------------------\n\n### When you share your friend list\n\nIf you use Facebook Login to log in to an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:\n\n* They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can't access non-public information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.\n* You'll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don't want to share your friends list with an app, or don't want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.\n\n### When your friends share their friend list\n\nYour friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login.

We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things such as users' experience with such content, products and services.\n\nThese reports aggregate information such as:\n\n* How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services\n* The [general demographics and interests\\[52\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-52) of the people who interacted with it\n* How people use our partners' products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks\n\nAdvertisers also receive other information.

For example, that means that if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer.

The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:\n\n* Were women\n* Were between the ages of 25 and 34\n* Clicked on the ad from their phone\n\n53\n\nWhen you might give us permission\n---------------------------------\n\nFor example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information.

For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things such as whether it best achieves the advertiser's goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads that we may show you. We use different factors, such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things such as your activity on Meta Products.

That’s why we’re developing AI at Meta, our collection of generative AI features and experiences, like Meta AI and AI Creative Tools, along with the models that power them. This also includes making models available through an open platform to support researchers, developers and others in the AI community.\n\nAI at Meta helps people solve complex problems, be more imaginative, and create something never seen before. From bringing real-time answers to chat, to helping people organize and plan for their next vacation, to giving them more ways to express themselves, AI at Meta helps people enhance their everyday activities, experiences and moments.\n\nWe are committed to building responsibly. We want you to know how generative AI works, and how we use your information to make this advancement possible.\n\nWhat is generative AI?\n----------------------\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (generative AI) enables people to quickly create content in new and exciting ways. For example, with generative AI people can easily create new content like images to share with friends, and businesses can create text responses for questions from their customers.\n\nGenerative AI is not a database or static collection of information but computer models. These models are a form of artificial intelligence that are trained on billions of pieces of information from different types of data like text, images and audio. By studying this information, it can learn things like the relationship and associations between different types of content. That way the models are able to create new content when a person gives it instructions or a question. Generative AI can be used to create a variety of content like text, images and audio.\n\n* Models that generate text: Large language models (also called LLMs) are models trained on massive amounts of text to help them predict typical sequences, like those found in our everyday language. LLMs learn from the data using a combination of machine learning and guidance given by people who help train the models. They can be trained to do different language-based tasks, like completing a sentence, translating text into a different language, or responding to questions in a conversational way.\n* Models that generate images: These models are trained by looking at billions of images and their text captions, which are the descriptive text associated with the images. The model learns the association between these text descriptions and the images. Once it’s learned the association, it can create new images, like when a person enters a text description of the image they want generated.\n\nGenerative AI models help machines better understand the world and let people translate that understanding into creative expression.\n\nWhere does Meta get training information?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSince it takes such a large amount of data to teach effective models, a combination of sources are used for training. We use information that is publicly available online and licensed information. We also use information shared on Meta Products. This information could be things like posts or photos and their captions. We do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs unless you or someone in the chat chooses to share those messages with our AIs. For AI features that use [Private Processing technology](https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffaq.whatsapp.com%2F2089630958184255%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_SECTION%253Agenai_body), Meta cannot read or access the private messages you have shared. There are more details on how we use information from Meta Products in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?section_id=2-HowDoWeUse&entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body).\n\nWhen we collect public information from the internet or license data from other providers to train our models, it may include personal information. For example, if we collect a public blog post it may include the author’s name and contact information. When we do get personal information as part of this public and licensed data that we use to train our models, we don’t specifically link this data to any Meta account.\n\nEven if you don’t use our Products or have an account, we may still process information about you to develop and improve AI at Meta. For example, this could happen if you appear anywhere in an image shared on our Products by someone who does use them or if someone mentions information about you in posts or captions that they share on our Products.\n\nPrivacy and generative AI\n-------------------------\n\nAt Meta, we have a responsibility to protect people’s privacy and have teams dedicated to this work for everything we build.\n\nWe have a robust internal Privacy Review process that helps ensure we are using data at Meta responsibly for our products, including generative AI. We work to identify potential privacy risks that involve the collection, use or sharing of personal information and develop ways to reduce those risks to people’s privacy. [Read more about our privacy programs and learn about our teams of experts.](https://about.meta.com/privacy-progress/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body)\n\nTo do this work ethically and responsibly, we have 5 foundational values at the core of how we think about AI. [Learn more about our 5 pillars.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/facebooks-five-pillars-of-responsible-ai/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body)\n\n* Privacy and security\n* Fairness and inclusion\n* Robustness and safety\n* Transparency and control\n* Governance and accountability\n\nOur AI responsibility efforts are propelled by a cross-disciplinary team whose mission is to help ensure that AI at Meta benefits people and society. Our work on responsible AI is driven by our belief that everyone should have equitable access to information, services, and opportunities. [Learn about our recent progress.](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/responsible-ai-progress-meta-2022/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body)\n\nWe’re investing so much in this space because we believe it provides benefits for people, creators and businesses around the world. That’s why we’re building AI at Meta and making models available through an open platform. To train effective models to unlock these advancements, a significant amount of information is needed. This is why we draw from publicly available and licensed sources, as well as information people have shared on Meta Products, including interactions with AI at Meta features. We keep training data for as long as we need it on a case-by-case basis to ensure an AI model is operating appropriately, safely and efficiently. We also may keep it to protect our or others' interests, or comply with legal obligations.\n\nWhether you use Meta Products or not, anyone can submit requests related to their personal information from third parties being used to develop and improve AI at Meta. [Learn more and submit requests here.](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1266025207620918?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3Agenai_body)\n\nWe see many possibilities ahead for people, creators and businesses to use generative AI. We’re excited to see this technology come this far but know that there’s more to do in the future. Generative AI is a fast-moving space and we are committed to staying transparent as this technology evolves."
