Then, we collect things such as:\n\n* Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, such as Facebook Pages and videos\n* Basic information about [devices\\[10\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf#annotation-10) that downloaded our apps, such as device model and OS\n\nWe also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, such as the Meta pixel or Social plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use our [business tools](https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/?helpref=uf_share&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) or other Meta Products.

Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.\n\n### Safety and integrity\n\nFor example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.\n\n### Performance\n\nFor example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don't have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.\n\n5\n\nFor example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, such as a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, such as a profile photo or payment information.\n\nWe also collect information you provide when you:\n\n* Create your avatar\n* Fill in a form\n* Contact us\n\n6\n\nWhat we collect from our camera feature\n---------------------------------------\n\nJosé likes using Instagram's Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo that he's about to take, we collect information from the camera, so we can apply the effect to his photo.\n\nHow filters, effects, masks and avatars work\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things such as fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It's not used to identify you.\n\nWhat we collect from voice-enabled features\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRen tells Meta's voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren's command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren's voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren's settings, improve the Assistant feature.\n\n7\n\n* Information about the content itself, such as the location where a photo was taken or the date that a file was created\n* Information about the message itself, such as the type of message or the date and time it was sent\n\n8\n\nFor example, we log:\n\n* What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products\n* What features you access from our messaging products\n* When you use [Social plugins](https://developers.facebook.com/products/social-plugins/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/facebook-login/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.12-AppsAndFeaturesYou), in-app browser link history or auto-fill\n* Information about websites that you visit or interact with when you use our in-app browser.

We also suggest content that's relevant to you.\n\nMany things influence the content that you see in your Feed.\n\nFor example:\n\n* If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.\n* If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.\n* If you've recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.\n* You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you're near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium.

The seller shares Jane's activity with us using our business tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.\n\nLater, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online shop.\n\nIf she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe shop again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur). Or if she doesn't want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nTopics that we think you might be interested in\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in \"music\".\n\nBased on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.\n\nJon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics?entry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nYour connections\n----------------\n\nFor example, Fiona's friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend's activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.\n\n31\n\nWe receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things such as nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.\n\n32\n\nStands for \"Internet protocol address\". It's a unique number assigned to a device, such as a phone or computer, which allows it to communicate over the Internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.\n\nJust like you need a postal address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the Internet.\n\n33\n\nPersonalising ads for you and others\n------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location services on his device and allowed location access in the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We'll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.\n\nLater, Marcus turns off Location services before he lands, so we don't collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address that we receive to estimate Marcus' general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.\n\n34\n\nFor example, we use information about the locations that you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log in to your account from a new location, we can check that it's really you.\n\n35\n\nA person, business, organisation or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services\n\n36\n\nFor example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25-34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.\n\n37\n\nA person, business, organisation or body that is not part of the Meta Companies\n\n38\n\nFor example we can:\n\n* Automatically fill in registration information, such as your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product\n* Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you\n* Show all interactions in one place for content you've crossposted to different Products\n\n39\n\nDevices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.\n\n40\n\nA person, business, organisation or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things such as investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.\n\nHow is your information shared on Meta Products or with integrated partners?\n============================================================================\n\nHighlights\n----------\n\n* You can choose to share information on our Products or with integrated partners\n* Remember to share only with people you trust\n* You might decide to use a product that integrates with one of ours, such as if you use Facebook Login to log in to a music service or a shopping site\n* If you do, that organisation will ask you to receive some information about you, such as your email address or date of birth\n\nLearn more about the different cases when your information can be shared on our [Products\\[41\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SECTION%3A3-HowIsYourInformation#annotation-41):\n\nPeople and accounts that you share and communicate with\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you share and communicate using our products, you can sometimes [choose the audience\\[42\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.1-PeopleAndAccountsYou#annotation-42) for what you share.\n\nWhen you interact with people or businesses, they can see:\n\nFor example, the audience you choose who can see when you:\n\n* Share a post that you've written\n* Share a photo or video\n* Create a story\n* Share a news article\n* Add information to your profile\n\nPeople you interact with can see what you send to them.

Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:\n\n* They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can't access non-public information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.\n* You'll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don't want to share your friends list with an app, or don't want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.\n\n### When your friends share their friend list\n\nYour friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login.

These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser's ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\\[50\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-50).\n\nMeta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:\n\n* Ads that people engaged with, if any\n* When people engaged with ads\n* Where that ad was shown (e.g. on Instagram or Facebook)\n\nWe also confirm which ads you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\\[51\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-51)\n\n### Audience Network publishers and their vendors\n\nMeta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.\n\nTo help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:\n\n* How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps\n* Information related to or in response to a [publisher's request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable&entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) to serve an ad on its app.\n\nBut we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\\[51\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork#annotation-51).\n\nPartners who use our analytics services\n---------------------------------------\n\nPeople rely on our [Products\\[52\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-52), such as business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses.

We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things such as users' experience with such content, products and services.\n\nThese reports aggregate information such as:\n\n* How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services\n* The [general demographics and interests\\[50\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#annotation-50) of the people who interacted with it\n* How people use our partners' products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks\n\nAdvertisers also receive other information. [Read our Policy](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.4-PartnersWhoUseOur#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.\n\nPartners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you choose to [make a transaction\\[53\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-53), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\\[54\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.6-PartnersWhoOfferGoods#annotation-54), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.\n\nDepending on how you interact with them, they receive:\n\n* Information to complete your transaction, such as order, payment, contact and delivery information\n* Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, such as information about your device or connection\n* Any information required by applicable regulation\n* Other information that you choose to share with them\n\nFor example, if you donate to a charity that receives funds through PayPal Giving Fund, your donation will be made to PayPal Giving Fund. The PayPal Giving Fund will receive information such as the transaction amount and name of the charity. Their payment service provider will also receive information needed to facilitate the payment, including your payment card credential information.\n\nIntegrated partners\n-------------------\n\nWhen you choose to use integrated partners' products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity.

The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser's Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.\n\nMarketing vendors\n-----------------\n\nWe share information about you with [marketing vendors\\[56\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/?entry_point=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A4.subpage.11-MarketingVendors#annotation-56). For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.\n\nMarketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:\n\n* Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices\n* Tracking and categorising your online and mobile app activity\n* Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions\n\nThese marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you.

That means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other trusted companies, such as search engine providers, so we can bring you the most relevant information.\n\nMeta sometimes shares the messages that you send to our AIs and general information, such as your region, with these companies so that you can get better results.

Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.\n\nYou can see the \"interests\" assigned to you in your [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A4.ex.4-GeneralDemographicsAndInterests) and remove them if you want.\n\nThe bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:\n\n* Were women\n* Were between the ages of 25 and 34\n* Clicked on the ad from their phone\n\n51\n\nFor example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information.
