Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F463983701520800%2F%3Fhelpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.\n\n### Safety and integrity\n\nWe can take action according to our Community Standards against someone without an account interacting with Meta Products. For example, we can share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.\n\n### Advertising\n\nFor example, you may also see ads for the [Meta Company Products](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmeta-company-products%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) shown through [Meta Audience Network](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F119468292028768%2F%3Fhelpref=search&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.41-InformationWeCollectIf) when you visit other apps if we can’t recognize you as a registered user of the Meta Products.\n\n### Performance\n\nFor example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.\n\n5\n\nFor example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.\n\nWe also collect information you provide when you:\n\n* Create your avatar\n* Fill out a form\n* Contact us\n\n6\n\nWhat we collect from our camera feature\n---------------------------------------\n\nJosé likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.\n\nHow filters, effects, masks and avatars work\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.\n\nWhat we collect from voice-enabled features\n-------------------------------------------\n\nRen tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.\n\n7\n\n* Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created\n* Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent\n\n8\n\nAcross Meta Company Products, you can interact with Meta’s generative AI features and experiences, collectively called [AI at Meta](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fgenai%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A1.ex.62-InformationYouOrOthersExchange).\n\nWe collect information when you or others use, or exchange information with, AI at Meta, such as:\n\n* Prompts that can include questions, messages, media and other information you or others share with or send to AI at Meta\n* Responses and other information you receive from AI at Meta.

For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F%3Fentry_point%3DPOLICY_ANNOTATION%253A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf).\n* When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsafety%2Fwellbeing%2Fsuicideprevention%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.\n* We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.\n\n### Who reviews this information\n\nOur reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F111814505650678%3Fref=tos&entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf) or for a trusted [service provider\\[41\\]](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/entry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.2-ManualReviewExamplesOf%23annotation-41).

The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.\n\nLater, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.\n\nIf she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her [Advertisers setting](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fadvertisers%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [Ad preferences](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fad_settings%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nTopics we think you might be interested in\n------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in \"music.\"\n\nBased on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.\n\nJon can manage his interests in his [ad topics](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fadpreferences%2Fad_topics%3Fentry_point=POLICY_STORY_ANNOTATION%3A2.story.6-YourActivityOnOur).\n\nYour connections\n----------------\n\nFor example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.\n\n31\n\nWe receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.\n\n32\n\nStands for \"internet protocol address.\" It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.\n\nJust like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.\n\n33\n\nPersonalizing ads for you and others\n------------------------------------\n\nFor example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.\n\nLater, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.\n\n34\n\nFor example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.\n\n35\n\nA person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services\n\n36\n\nFor example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.\n\n37\n\nA person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies\n\n38\n\nFor example we can:\n\n* Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product\n* Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you\n* Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products\n\n39\n\nFor example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team’s Page on Facebook.\n\n[Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/printable/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meta.com%2Fhelp%2Faccounts-center%2F433719745369721%2F%3Fentry_point=POLICY_ANNOTATION%3A2.ex.7-UsingYourInformationIf) about how we use information across accounts if you add accounts to the same Accounts Center.\n\n40\n\nDevices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.\n\n41\n\nA person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta.

We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products.
